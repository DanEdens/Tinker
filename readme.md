## Lessons Learned

### AI Pair Programming
- Test coverage drives AI decision making - untested features may be removed during refactoring
- Using git history in conversations helps AI understand and restore previously working code
- Maintaining a "Lessons Learned" section helps keep important details in focus during iterations
- When dealing with complex UI elements, instruct AI to comment out code instead of deleting
- Clean commits with clear messages improve AI's ability to reference past solutions
- Complex UI features require comprehensive test coverage to prevent unintended removal
- Git squashing can improve the usefulness of commit history in AI conversations

### WebView Management
- WebView instances should be owned by their respective tabs
- Strong references to parent windows must be maintained
- Proper display parameters are crucial for preventing frame issues
- IPC handlers need careful error handling and type checking
- Event handling should be bi-directional (UI ↔ Backend)
- UI state should be explicitly synced after backend operations
- Error handling should include user feedback
- WebView creation should be atomic (succeed completely or fail safely)
- Environment variables should be used for configurable defaults
- Tab bar construction should use proper encapsulation and initialization
- Window chrome integration requires careful coordination with native controls
- WebViews need explicit z-index management to prevent overlap issues
- Tab switching must properly handle WebView visibility and focus
- Content WebViews should be positioned relative to tab bar height
- Each tab's WebView should maintain its own state independently
- WebView cleanup must be explicit to prevent memory leaks
- Tab creation and closing operations need proper state synchronization
- Window resize events must update all WebView bounds correctly
- Tab bar visibility must be maintained during tab operations
- WebView bounds must be updated after tab operations to maintain layout
- Use !important CSS rules for critical UI elements that must stay visible

### Menu System Design
- Native menu APIs can be inconsistent across platforms
- HTML/CSS menus provide better control and consistency
- WebView-based UI components need proper z-index management
- Keyboard shortcuts should be handled at both UI and system levels

### Event System Design
- Events should have clear success/failure feedback
- UI state must be kept in sync with backend state
- Error handling should be comprehensive and user-friendly
- Event handlers should be properly scoped and cleaned up
- Event propagation should be predictable and traceable

### Lessons Learned

#### MQTT Event System
- MQTT broker URL must be properly parsed to extract host and port
- Port should be taken from the URL or default to 1883
- Connection errors should be handled gracefully with reconnection attempts
- Event system should maintain its own state for reconnection handling
- Broker URL should be stored for debugging and reconnection purposes
- Connection status messages help track client connectivity
- Status messages should include client ID, timestamp, and broker details
- Use QoS::AtLeastOnce for important status messages
- Always ensure MQTT URLs have the mqtt:// scheme prefix
- Provide fallback to localhost if URL parsing fails
