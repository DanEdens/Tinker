# TestBrowser

A modern browser built from the ground up with testing, verification, and automation at its core. TestBrowser leverages MQTT-based event handling and provides comprehensive API control for testing frameworks.

## Vision

TestBrowser aims to bridge the gap between web browsing and test automation by creating a browser that treats testing as a first-class citizen. By building testing capabilities directly into the browser core, we enable more reliable, observable, and controllable web testing.

## Key Features

- üîÑ MQTT-based event handling system
- üéÆ Complete API control for external test frameworks
- üìä Built-in test reporting and analytics
- üîç Internal test management system
- üìù Automated report generation
- üîÑ Reproducible browsing sessions
- üéØ Deterministic event handling
