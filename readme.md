# Tinker

A meticulously engineered browser built for tinkerers and test enthusiasts. Tinker treats web testing as a craft, combining precision mechanics with MQTT-based event handling to create the ultimate testing workbench.

## The Blueprint

Born in a workshop of web innovation, Tinker aims to reimagine browser testing through ingenious engineering. By building testing capabilities directly into the browser's machinery, we provide craftspeople with the tools they need for reliable, observable, and controllable web testing.

- 📝 Added event recording and replay functionality
- 🎯 Implemented CLI interface with version support and descriptive help
- 🔧 Fixed test suite issues and improved test reliability
- 🎨 Added custom HTML/CSS menu bar with full keyboard shortcut support

## Lessons Learned

### WebView Management
- WebView instances should be owned by their respective tabs
- Strong references to parent windows must be maintained
- Proper display parameters are crucial for preventing frame issues
- IPC handlers need careful error handling and type checking

### Menu System Design
- Native menu APIs can be inconsistent across platforms
- HTML/CSS menus provide better control and consistency
- WebView-based UI components need proper z-index management
- Keyboard shortcuts should be handled at both UI and system levels

### JavaScript Engine Integration
- 🎯 Primary Focus: V8 Engine Integration
  - Industry standard JavaScript engine
  - Powers Chrome and Edge browsers
  - Extensive tooling and debugging capabilities

- 🔄 Future Engine Support:
  - SpiderMonkey (Firefox)
  - JavaScriptCore (Safari)

- 🏗️ Architecture Design:
  - Common interface layer for all engines
  - Engine-specific implementations isolated in modules
  - Unified manager for engine operations
  - Hot-swapping capability for testing different engines

- 🧪 Testing Considerations:
  - Performance benchmarking between engines
  - Compatibility testing across engines
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Script execution timing analysis

- 📊 Metrics Collection:
  - Script execution time
  - Memory consumption
  - Garbage collection patterns
  - Error handling differences

- 🔍 Development Approach:
  1. Implement V8 integration first
  2. Add engine selection configuration
  3. Build performance monitoring
  4. Add remaining engines as needed
  5. Implement comparison tooling
