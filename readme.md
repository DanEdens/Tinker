# TestBrowser

A modern browser built from the ground up with testing, verification, and automation at its core. TestBrowser leverages MQTT-based event handling and provides comprehensive API control for testing frameworks.

## Vision

TestBrowser aims to bridge the gap between web browsing and test automation by creating a browser that treats testing as a first-class citizen. By building testing capabilities directly into the browser core, we enable more reliable, observable, and controllable web testing.

## Key Features

- 🔄 MQTT-based event handling system
- 🎮 Complete API control for external test frameworks
- 📊 Built-in test reporting and analytics
- 🔍 Internal test management system
- 📝 Automated report generation
- 🔄 Reproducible browsing sessions
- 🎯 Deterministic event handling
