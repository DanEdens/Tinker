# Tinker

A meticulously engineered browser built for tinkerers and test enthusiasts. Tinker treats web testing as a craft, combining precision mechanics with MQTT-based event handling to create the ultimate testing workbench.

## The Blueprint

Born in a workshop of web innovation, Tinker aims to reimagine browser testing through ingenious engineering. By building testing capabilities directly into the browser's machinery, we provide craftspeople with the tools they need for reliable, observable, and controllable web testing.
